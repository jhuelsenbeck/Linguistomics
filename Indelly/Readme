The program requires the use of two libraries. The first is boost, which can
be found here:

    https://www.boost.org
    
I've had difficulties with boost on the MacOS in the past. I install it in my user
account and point the compiler there. (I install it in /Users/johnh/Applications/boost. 
Your location will obviously be different.)

The other dependency is the Eigen library. Eigen can be downloaded here:

It's a fantastic library for doing matrix computations in C++. I install it in the 
same directory that I install boost, though you are free to do differently. 

Here are other details of the settings I use in Xcode on the MacOS to get the 
program to compile.
